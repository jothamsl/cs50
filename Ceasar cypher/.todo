[v] Implement ceasar cypher algorithm
---[v] Program must accept a single command-line 
      argument which must be a non-negative integer
      
------[v] If program is executed without any command-line 
         arguments or with more than a single argument, print
         an error message and return from main a value of 1.

------[v] If any of the characters in the command-line argument
         is not a decimal digit, the program should print "Usage ./caesar key"
         and return 1.

---[v] Program must output "plaintext:" then prompt user for a string of plaintext
---[v] Program must output "ciphertext:" followed by the plaintext's corresponding
      cyphertext with each alphabetical character in the plaintext "rotated" by k 
      positions; non-alphabetical characters should be outputted unchanged.

---[v] Program must preserve caesar case

---[v] After outputting cyphertext, program should exit by returning 0 from main.
